About the project: 
	There are many cases reported of certificate forgery every day and many of them go undetected. The purpose of this study is to develop a system that would authenticate certificates to their real owners and could verify the same on a specific portal. To achieve this, in thispaper we focus on Ethereum Blockchain as it is immutable, transparent, scalable, and also cost-effective. Universities would be able to generate their own certificates on the web portal itself by uploading their certificate template in Scalable Vector Graphics(SVG) format and the student data in Comma-separated Values(CSV) format. Each generated certificate would be allotted to the respective student within the system. Each certificate would be given a unique hash code so that it could be verified easily and there would be no scope of duplication. The authentication and verification would be done on the same web portal. To sum up, this method would save time and efforts that are required to verify a certificate manually and would result in an effective, secure way to generate certificates.
